⚠️  CONTEXT OVERFLOW: prompt ~35814 tok + 500 response = 36826 tok  >  num_ctx 8192.  Bumping num_ctx → 36864.  This triggers a model reload (~2min on CPU). Use 3 or fewer chunks to stay within 8192 and avoid this.
The attached file `rag_gui.py` is the **main graphical user interface (GUI) application** for AI Prowler.

It provides a complete windowed interface for:

- **Indexing documents** — Browse and queue folders/files, start/pause/stop indexing, with progress tracking and smart scan options
- **Asking questions** — Type or speak questions (via Whisper voice input), attach files, select AI providers (local Ollama or external APIs like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini), and view answers with detected code files you can save
- **Updating the index** — View tracked directories, update selected or all directories, remove directories from tracking
- **Scheduling automatic updates** — Set daily or weekday update schedules via Windows Task Scheduler
- **Configuring smart scan** — Edit which file extensions are indexed or skipped, and which directories to ignore
- **Settings** — Change AI models, configure external API keys, adjust GPU acceleration, set microphone silence thresholds, enable auto-start for Ollama, and view database statistics

The GUI runs entirely locally, connects to the Ollama AI engine for inference, and can optionally auto-start/stop Ollama when the application opens and closes. It works alongside `rag_preprocessor.py` which handles the actual indexing and query logic.
